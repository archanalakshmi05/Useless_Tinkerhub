### Project Description
The Useless Tinkerhub project is a chatbot application that integrates memory features, allowing it to retain user interactions, and Google Maps API for location-based responses. Built using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB, this chatbot can retrieve and display information about locations, including images, while providing a personalized conversation experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are really in search of it

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is simple just manifest everything and dream.

## Technical Details
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the technologies and components used in the project:

---

### Technologies/Components Used

#### For Software:
- **Languages Used**:
  - JavaScript (Node.js, React)

- **Frameworks Used**:
  - Express (for backend server)

- **Libraries Used**:
  - Axios (for making HTTP requests)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB integration)
  - @googlemaps/google-maps-services-js (for Google Maps API)
  - UUID (for generating unique user IDs)
  - Lucide React (for UI icons)

- **Tools Used**:
  - Git (for version control)
  - MongoDB Compass (for database management, optional)
  - Visual Studio Code (as the code editor)
  - Node Package Manager (npm) for managing dependencies

#### For Hardware:
- **Main Components**:
  - Computer or server with internet access to host and run the chatbot

- **Specifications**:
  - Minimum 2GB RAM
  - Node.js v16 or higher
  - MongoDB installed locally or accessible via MongoDB Atlas

- **Tools Required**:
  - Internet connection (for Google Maps API requests)
  - MongoDB server, either local or remote (for storing data)

Here‚Äôs an implementation section for your `README.md`, with commands for installation, running the project, and documentation pointers.

### Implementation

#### For Software:

##### Installation
Run these commands to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/archanalakshmi05/Useless_Tinkerhub.git
   cd Useless_Tinkerhub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally, or provide the connection URI if using MongoDB Atlas.
   - Obtain a Google Maps API key and update it in `mapsHandler.js`.

##### Run
Start the server and the application with the following commands:

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

### Project Documentation

#### For Software:
- **Code Structure**: The main components of the chatbot are organized as follows:
  - `server.js`: Configures the Express server and routes.
  - `database.js`: Handles MongoDB connection and schema definitions.
  - `chatbot.js`: Main React component for the chatbot interface.
  - `mapsHandler.js`: Contains functions to interact with Google Maps API.
  
- **Google Maps API**: Ensure API keys are configured in `mapsHandler.js` for location-based services.

- **MongoDB Configuration**: MongoDB is used for storing chat memory and location data; make sure the MongoDB instance is properly set up and reachable.

You just work on this and create out something bigger and funnier not rely on others okay:)
